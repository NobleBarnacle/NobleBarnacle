//NOTES:

/* the schema differs from Trevor's spec in the following
ways:

-"Years" is no longer a top-level key in the model object; it is now a property
on gAndA objects, employee objects, startup cost objects, debt and equity objects,
and revenue source objects. This is because the nesting of properties was getting
out of control. You can find the key 'years' on each of these items as an array of numbers.

-The same is also true of gAndA expenses. They're no longer nested like they were
in Trevor's example JSON object--they're individual objects with a "category" property.
